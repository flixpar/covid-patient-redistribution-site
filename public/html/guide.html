			<p>Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic local surges have caused many hospitals across the US to reach or exceed their capacity, and with the ongoing spread of the virus we expect this to continue. Hospitals can cope with surges through a variety of methods, which typically involve opening up capacity, but these are often costly and can hurt the level of care that patients receive. A promising alternative method for reducing the burden on hospitals is to optimally transfer patients from over-capacity hospitals to nearby hospitals that have available space. This dashboard allows you to explore the potential impact of patient transfers on hospital systems around the US.</p>
			<br>
			<p>This site is organized into a few pages. The <a href="/patients-static">Dashboard</a> page allows you to select a state and patient level-of-care, and see the impact transfers would have on hospitals state-wide. The <a href="/patients-interactive">Customize Results</a> page allows you to go deeper and modify the parameters to our optimal redistribution model, which runs in real-time to update the results. You can set parameters like a limit on the number of transfers that can be done, how far patients can be transferred, and what metric the model should try to optimize. You can also select the specific hospitals and date range you are interested in. The <a href="/hospital-selection">Nearby Hospitals</a> page shows you all of the hospitals near you and how much capacity they have left so you can make informed decisions on where to go to the hospital. Finally, the <a href="/about#about">About</a> page will give you more details about this project.</p>
			<br>
			<p>The <a href="/patients-static">Dashboard</a> and <a href="/patients-interactive">Customize Results</a> pages allow you to visualize and explore the toll that COVID is taking on hospitals as well as the potential benefits that patient transfers could have in many ways. Want to visualize the transfers we recommend and the load hospitals would face? Take a look at the map of COVID occupancy and transfers. Want to see how transfers help hospitals that will be over capacity? Check out the hospital-level COVID occupancy figure. Want to look into the empirical effect of COVID and transfers on the shortages at hospitals? Go to the metrics section.</p>
